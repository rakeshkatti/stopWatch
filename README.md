##Simple stopwatch using JavaScript

[You can view the demo of this project here](http://rakeshkatti.com/stopwatch/)

This is my first attempt to angular.js

This stopwatch uses system timestamp to display time elapsed at any point of time.

You can operate this stop watch in three modes.

* LAP Timer
* SPLIT Timer
* SPLITS within a LAP Timer

Thanks to foundation for making it responsive.
